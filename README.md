Developer workflow orchestration CLI. Syncs data from Jira and GitHub into a ticket-centric folder structure and provides an AI orchestrator (Claude Code session) that reviews state and produces artifacts.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd duct-cli
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

duct init --workspace-root ~/workspace/duct
```

## Configuration

Set environment variables for external service auth:

```bash
export JIRA_EMAIL="you@company.com"
export JIRA_TOKEN="your-jira-api-token"
export GH_TOKEN="your-github-pat"
```

Edit `config.yaml` in your workspace root to configure the Jira domain, JQL query, repo paths, trust tiers, and sync intervals.

## Commands

## Workspace Structure

```
{workspace_root}/
    config.yaml
    PRIORITY.md
    WORKFLOW.md
    .claude/CLAUDE.md
    {EPIC_KEY}-{slug}/
        {TICKET_KEY}-{slug}/
            orchestrator/
                TICKET.md              # sync: Jira data
                PULL_REQUESTS.md       # sync: GitHub PRs
                CI.md                  # sync: build status
                CLAUDE_SESSIONS.md     # sync: active sessions
                WORKSPACE.md           # sync: git state
                BACKGROUND.md          # authored: context
                AC.md                  # authored: acceptance criteria
                SPEC.md                # authored: technical spec
                ORCHESTRATOR.md        # authored: working notes
            repo-worktree/
    .archive/
```

Files with `source: sync` frontmatter are overwritten each sync cycle. Authored files are created by the developer or orchestrator and persist.

## Development

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest                  # run tests
ruff check src/ tests/  # lint
```

## Architecture

duct is a Python package with a library-first design. The CLI (`duct.cli`) is a thin wrapper around the library. A Python TUI can import the library directly; a Rust TUI can use subprocess + `--json` output.

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the full specification.
